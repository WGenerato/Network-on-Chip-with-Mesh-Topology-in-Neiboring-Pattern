# Network-on-Chip-with-Mesh-Topology-in-Neiboring-Pattern

A NoC system using SystemC. This system consisting of routers (switches) and IPs. The main interconnection structure (topology) being used is mesh.

 For neighboring pattern, the packets are sent vertically across the routers and IP cores. It offers slightly faster packet transfer speed compared to its uniform counterpart.
